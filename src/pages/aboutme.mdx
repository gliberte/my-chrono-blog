# About me

I was born in Nicaragua. I have lived in Panama since 1988 when I moved with my family when I was 16 years old. I studied science baccalaureate at the Pedro Pablo SÃ¡nchez de La Chorrera Secondary School, where I was proud to graduate among the top 20 distinguished positions. Back then, they implemented a computer lab at school, where I received my first lessons. I learned those magical commands that open up worlds of possibilities: "copy *. * A: B". At that time I fell in love with those applications with dark interfaces, such as "WordStar", "Lotus 1 2 3", etc. It was love at first sight.

I entered the University of Panama to study Bachelor of Mathematics with the idea of dedicating myself to teaching. Bad idea for a foreigner. Programming was always of great interest to me. At university, I spent more time than I needed in computer labs, after regular classes in the programming course with Turbo Basic for applying numerical methods, and played with compilers. My first program was a simulated horse racing betting game. When I finished my degree in mathematics, I wanted to start my computer engineering career; But my financial situation as an adult and that of my family did not allow me to materialize that idea. I had to get used to the idea of looking for a job and forget about computing for the moment.

Teaching jobs for a foreigner were very few. Upon receiving my diploma, I looked for a job teaching courses on computers (MS-DOS, Word, Excel, WordPerfect, Window 3.11, etc). Later, I got a job as a computer and mathematics teacher in some private schools. Finally, I decided that the teaching profession was not for me, so I began to complement my computer knowledge on my own. I learned to use computer programs on GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and the rudiments on that exciting discipline. I started working at the defunct company Geoinfo S.A. And then I looked for a job in Barraza y Cia, where I have been working for 9 years now.

With the evolution of web development technologies, and the growing importance of the cloud as a development environment, I was teaching myself in programming with Javascript, HTML and CSS. Then I went on to NodeJs for the server environment. I call myself a Full Stack Web Developer, but I definitely have a lot to learn in this changing world of web application programming and associated technologies.
